# SupportWheelOfFate

## How to:
1. Open solution in Visual Studio 2017 (2015 should also work).
2. Run SupportWheelOfFate.WebUI

## Disclaimer
Don't be suprised if after refresh selected shift engineers will not change - they were choosen for todays shift. 
Tomorrow Wheel of Fate will choose others ;)

## But how can I know if the business requirements has been met?
Simply run DefaultSupportEngineerFilterFactoryIntegrationTests they will prove that 10 engineers in 10 days will have 2 shifts each, 
and that none of engineers will have shift in consequent days.
